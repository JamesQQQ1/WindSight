# AI Agent Framework for WindSightAI

## Section 1: Imports and Setup

### Subsection 1.1: Importing Required Libraries
This framework leverages advanced libraries for geospatial analysis, machine learning, AI modeling, predictive analytics, and data visualization. Each library is selected for its scalability, precision, and integration capabilities.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import rasterio
from rasterio.features import rasterize
from rasterio.transform import from_origin
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import rioxarray
import os
import netCDF4 as nc
from netCDF4 import Dataset
from geopy.distance import great_circle
import pandas as pd
import simplekml
import openai
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import json
import datetime
import logging
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from scipy.stats import linregress, zscore
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon
import geopandas.tools
import plotly.express as px
from PIL import Image
```

### Subsection 1.2: Directory Setup
Define and create directories for structured project management. This setup ensures seamless integration of workflows, backup, and reproducibility of results.

```python
base_directory = '/path/to/ai_agent_framework'
data_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'Data')
output_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'Output')
logs_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'Logs')
reports_directory = os.path.join(output_directory, 'Reports')
visualizations_directory = os.path.join(output_directory, 'Visualizations')
cache_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'Cache')
exports_directory = os.path.join(output_directory, 'Exports')
data_backup_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'Backup')
models_directory = os.path.join(base_directory, 'Models')
interactive_dashboards_directory = os.path.join(output_directory, 'Dashboards')

# Create necessary directories
for directory in [data_directory, output_directory, logs_directory, reports_directory, visualizations_directory, cache_directory, exports_directory, data_backup_directory, models_directory, interactive_dashboards_directory]:
    os.makedirs(directory, exist_ok=True)
```

### Subsection 1.3: Enhanced Logging Configuration
Configure logging with multi-level outputs for real-time monitoring and issue debugging. Logs include task execution details, warnings, and system diagnostics.

```python
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

log_file = os.path.join(logs_directory, 'ai_framework.log')
debug_log_file = os.path.join(logs_directory, 'debug.log')

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        RotatingFileHandler(log_file, maxBytes=10*1024*1024, backupCount=5),
        RotatingFileHandler(debug_log_file, maxBytes=5*1024*1024, backupCount=3),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)
logging.info("AI Agent Framework initialized.")
```

### Subsection 1.4: API Key Configuration
Include a secure placeholder for OpenAI API keys. Ensure keys are securely stored and accessed via environment variables to prevent unauthorized access.

```python
# OpenAI API Key Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your-openai-api-key-placeholder")
if not OPENAI_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY == "your-openai-api-key-placeholder":
    logging.warning("OpenAI API key is missing or not configured correctly.")
else:
    openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
    logging.info("OpenAI API key loaded successfully.")
```

### Subsection 1.5: Comprehensive AI Agent Prompts
Expand the range of prompts to cover both creative and analytical tasks. Each prompt is designed to maximize the capabilities of OpenAI models for domain-specific insights.

```python
agent_prompts = {
    "analyze_climate": "Analyze the provided climate dataset for trends, correlations, anomalies, and potential impacts. Highlight long-term implications.",
    "optimize_energy": "Recommend optimal renewable energy installation locations. Consider wind, solar, population density, and environmental constraints.",
    "generate_report": "Create a detailed report summarizing findings. Include data visualizations, comparisons, recommendations, and long-term projections.",

    "generate_3d_model": "Design a 3D model for renewable energy site layouts based on specifications like turbine placement and solar panel configurations.",
    "create_marketing_materials": "Draft creative marketing content for renewable energy projects. Include infographics and key benefits.",
    "simulate_extreme_events": "Simulate the impacts of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes or heatwaves, on energy infrastructure.",
    "forecast_land_use": "Predict future land use changes using historical data and scenario projections.",
    "model_energy_grid": "Design and optimize an energy grid layout for efficient integration of renewable resources.",
    "generate_infographic": "Create an engaging infographic summarizing analysis results. Include data highlights and compelling visuals.",
    "enhance_visuals": "Improve existing visuals for presentations or publications. Focus on clarity, aesthetics, and accuracy.",
    "simulate_population_movement": "Model population shifts due to environmental changes or urban development trends.",
