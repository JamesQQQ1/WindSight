						<!-- Framework -->
							<article id="framework">
								<h2 class="major">AI Agent Framework</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="AI Framework" /></span>
								<p>The AI Agent Framework is the cornerstone of WindSightAI. This modular system enables autonomous environmental analysis by deploying intelligent agents, each specialized for specific tasks. These agents work collaboratively, leveraging their unique capabilities to deliver comprehensive insights.</p>
								<p>OpenAIâ€™s GPT models are integral to this framework, providing natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. These models enable users to interact with the system through conversational queries, making complex analyses accessible to non-technical users. Additionally, the framework is designed to integrate other large language models (LLMs) to enhance data synthesis, pattern recognition, and predictive accuracy.</p>
								<p>Future iterations will incorporate reinforcement learning to optimize agent decision-making processes. This will allow the system to improve over time, adapting to new data and evolving requirements. The addition of multi-modal capabilities will further enhance the framework, enabling agents to analyze images, videos, and real-time sensor data alongside traditional datasets.</p>
								<p>By combining advanced AI methodologies with robust geospatial analytics, the AI Agent Framework not only streamlines environmental analysis but also redefines it. Its ability to scale from localized studies to global simulations makes it a powerful tool for addressing a wide range of environmental and climate challenges.</p>
