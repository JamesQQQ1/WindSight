						<!-- Framework -->
							<article id="framework">
								<h2 class="major">AI Agent Framework</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="AI Framework" /></span>
								<p>The AI Agent Framework of WindSightAI is the backbone of its revolutionary capabilities. Designed to autonomously handle vast and diverse datasets, the framework is built on three core principles: modularity, adaptability, and intelligence. Each AI agent is specialized for a particular task—from data ingestion and cleaning to geospatial modeling and scenario analysis—allowing the framework to function seamlessly across different domains.</p>
								<p>At the heart of the framework is its integration with OpenAI’s GPT and other large language models (LLMs). This allows WindSightAI to perform advanced natural language queries, enabling users to interact with the platform intuitively. Imagine asking an AI agent to ‘Identify areas with the highest wind energy potential under scenario X,’ and receiving a detailed, visualized report within moments.</p>
								<p>Future enhancements will include reinforcement learning for optimization tasks, enabling AI agents to learn from past analyses to improve their accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, multi-agent collaboration will allow AI agents to work together dynamically, sharing insights and refining outcomes in real-time.</p>
								<p>By leveraging state-of-the-art AI, WindSightAI transforms static datasets into dynamic, actionable intelligence, ensuring that decision-makers are always equipped with the best tools to address their challenges.</p>
